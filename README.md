## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://reactjs.org/) - Type Checking
- [Taiwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) - State Management

### What I learned

This project was my first experience using Zustand for state management. Zustand is a lightweight
and intuitive state-management library for React applications. It simplifies state management
compared to more complex solutions like Redux.

### Continued development

Moving forward, there are several areas I plan to focus on to enhance my skills and improve the
project:

1. Advanced Zustand Patterns

- Selectors and Computed States: Explore using selectors for more efficient state access and
  computed states to derive values from the store.
- Middleware: Implement middleware for logging, persistence, and other side effects.

2. Testing

- Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the Zustand store to ensure state management logic is robust
  and error-free.
- Integration Testing: Conduct integration tests to verify the interaction between components and
  the Zustand store.
